    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Current finance problems can be mainly tackled by three areas of quantum algorithms: quantum simulation, quantum optimization, and quantum machine learning [1,2]. Many financial problems are essentially combinatorial optimization problems, and corresponding algorithms usually have high time complexity and are difficult to implement. Due to the power of quantum computing, these complex problems are expected to be solved by quantum algorithms in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Quantum Finance module of Paddle Quantum focuses on quantum optimization: how to apply quantum algorithms in real finance optimization problems. This tutorial focuses on how to use quantum algorithms to solve the portfolio optimization problem."

    "## Portfolio Optimization Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "A portfolio is a collection of financial investments, such as stocks, bonds, cash, etc. Many investment managers face the portfolio optimization problem. This problem requires practitioners to invest various projects, according to their target returns and risks. This aims to minimize the risk given certain return or maximize the return given certain risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed description of portfolio optimization is as follows: If you are an active investment manager who wants to invest $K$ dollars to $N$ projects, each with its own return and risk, your goal is to find an optimal way to invest the projects, taking into account the market impact and transaction costs."

    "### Encoding Portfolio Optimization Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "To transform the portfolio optimization problem into a problem applicable for parameterized quantum circuits, we need to encode portfolio optimization problem into a Hamiltonian. To make the modeling easy to formulate, two assumptions are made to constrain the problem：\n",
    "* Each asset is invested with an equal amount of money.\n",
    "* Budget is a multiple of each investment amount and must be fully spent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model we unitize the investment amount, i.e., if the budget is $3$, then the manager should invest $3$ assets. Since the actual investment budget is limited and there are many investable assets, it is important to set the number of investable assets larger than the budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the theory of portfolio optimization, the overall risk of a portfolio is related to the covariance between assets, which is proportional to the correlation coefficients of any two assets. The smaller the correlation coefficients, the smaller the covariance, and then the smaller the overall risk of the portfolio [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we use the mean-variance approach to model this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\omega = \\max _{x \\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}} \\mu^{T} x - q x^{T} S x \\quad\\quad  \\tag{1}\n",
    "\\text { subject to: } 1^{T} x=B,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where each symbol has the following meaning:\n",
    "* $x\\in {\\{0,1\\}}^N$ denotes the vector of binary decision variables, which indicate which each assets is picked ($x_i=1$) or not ($x_i = 0$),\n",
    "* $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ defines the expected returns for the assets,\n",
    "* $S \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ represents the covariances between the assets,\n",
    "* $q > 0$ represents the risk factor of investment decision making,\n",
    "* $\\mathbb{1}$ denotes a vector with all values of $1$,\n",
    "* $B$ denotes the budget, i.e. the number of assets to be selected out of $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the model equation, we can define the loss function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C_x = q \\sum_i  \\sum_j s_{ji}x_ix_j - \\sum_{i}x_i \\mu_i + A \\left(B - \\sum_i x_i\\right)^2,  \\tag{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $s_{ij}$ denotes the elements of the covariance matrix $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the loss function is to be optimized using the gradient descent method, some modifications are made in the definition based on the equations of the model. The first term represents the risk of the investment. The second term represents the expected return on this investment. The third term constrains the budget $B$ to be invested evenly in different projects. $A$ is the penalty parameter, usually set to a larger number. \n",
    "\n",
    "We now need to transform the cost function $C_x$ into a Hamiltonian to realize the encoding of the portfolio optimization problem. Each variable $x_{i}$ has two possible values, $0$ and $1$, corresponding to quantum states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$. Note that every variable corresponds to a qubit and so $n$ qubits are needed for solving the portfolio optimization problem. The Pauli $Z$ operator has two eigenstates, $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ . Their corresponding eigenvalues are 1 and -1, respectively. So we consider encoding the cost function as a Hamiltonian using the pauli $Z$ matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we would like to consider the mapping\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_{i} \\mapsto \\frac{I-Z_{i}}{2}, \\tag{4}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Z_{i} = I \\otimes I \\otimes \\ldots \\otimes Z \\otimes \\ldots \\otimes I$ with $Z$ operates on the qubit at position $i$. Under this mapping, the value of $x_i$ can be illustrated in a different way. If the qubit $i$ is in state $|1\\rangle$, then $x_{i} |1\\rangle = \\frac{I-Z_{i}}{2} |1\\rangle = 1|1\\rangle $, which means that the stork $i$ is in the optimal portfolio. Also, for a qubit $i$ in state $|0\\rangle$, $x_{i}|0\\rangle  = \\frac{I-Z_{i}}{2} |0\\rangle = 0 |0\\rangle $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus using the above mapping, we can transform the cost function $C_x$ into a Hamiltonian $H_C$ for the system of $n$ qubits and realize the quantumization of the portfolio optimization problem. Then the ground state of $H_C$ is the optimal solution to the portfolio optimization problem. In the following section, we will show how to use a parameterized quantum circuit to find the ground state, i.e., the eigenvector with the smallest eigenvalue."

    "After obtaining the minimum value of the loss function and the corresponding set of parameters $\\vec{\\theta}^*$, our task has not been completed. In order to obtain an approximate solution to the portfolio optimization problem, it is necessary to decode the solution to the classical optimization problem from the quantum state $|\\vec{\\theta}^*\\rangle$ output by the circuit. Physically, to decode a quantum state, we need to measure it and then calculate the probability distribution of the measurement results:\n",

    "In this tutorial, the optimal solution to the portfolio optimization is approximated through the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) based on the mean-variance approach. Given the budget, available assets and investment risks, the parameterized quantum circuits is applied to find the optimal portfolio by calculating the returns of investment projects and the covariance matrix between the returns of each investment project.
