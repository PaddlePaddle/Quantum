    "### Combinatorial optimization problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In applied mathematics and theoretical computer science, combinatorial optimization is a type of topic that finds the optimal object in a discrete set of objects. In simple terms, the combinatorial optimization problem means that all solutions of the problem are composed of discrete variables, and the optimal solution is to be found in the discrete solution set. Combinatorial optimization problems involve a wide range of areas and are common in real life, such as the design of aircraft routes and the planning of express delivery routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, a combinatorial optimization problem can be described by $n$ bits and $m$ clauses. Each bit is a binary variable whose value is $0$ or $1$, and we use $z_j$ to denote the value of the $j$th bit. Therefore, the value of these $n$ bits can be represented by the bit string $z=z_1z_2\\dots z_n$. Each clause is a restriction on some bits. For example, a clause can require the value of the $2$nd bit to be $0$, or it can require the value of the $3$rd bit and the $5$th bit to be the same. For the $j$th clause, we define a function\n",

    "\\end{cases}.\n",

This problem asks that, given $n$ bits and $m$ clauses as inputs, if there exists a value these bits can take so that all the $m$ clauses are satisfied simultaneously. An optimization problem related to SAT is MAX-SAT, which asks that what value these $n$ bits should take so that as many as possible clauses are satisfied. It is worth noting that the way we define a combinatorial optimization problem above is to formulate it as MAX-SAT, or more precisely, weighted MAX-SAT."

    "In the previous paragraph, we simplify the search for the quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$ into the search for the parameterized quantum state $|\\vec{\\gamma},\\vec{\\beta}\\rangle$, but at the same time, we have also reduced the search space. That is to say, given the number of layers $p$, there may be no parameters $\\vec{\\gamma},\\vec{\\beta}$ such that $F_p(\\vec{\\gamma},\\vec{\\beta}) = C(z_\\text{opt})$. Suppose that the parameters $\\vec{\\gamma}^*$ and $\\vec{\\beta}^*$ make $F_p$ the largest, that is, $F_p(\\vec{\\gamma}^*,\\vec{\\beta}^* ) = M_p$. Then under ideal circumstances, the quantum state $|\\vec{\\gamma}^*,\\vec{\\beta}^*\\rangle$ contains the information of an optimal solution. But it should be noted that only $p$ layers are used here, so it is very likely that $M_p < C(z_\\text{opt})$. Therefore, in general $|\\vec{\\gamma}^*,\\vec{\\beta}^*\\rangle$ only contains information about an approximate optimal solution. Furthermore, we assume that the quantum state $|\\vec{\\gamma}^*,\\vec{\\beta}^*\\rangle$ is the superposition state of $l$ computational basis state, namely\n",

    "Normally, the larger the probability $|c_j|^2$ that a state $|z^{(j)}\\rangle$ is measured on the computational basis, the more likely that the corresponding bit string $z^{(j) }$ is an optimal solution. Thus, we prepare $|\\vec{\\gamma}^*,\\vec{\\beta}^*\\rangle$ and measure it to get a bit string $z$ and calculate the value of $C(z)$. Repeat this process many times, and we can get a bit string $z$ that makes $C(z)$ close to or even exceed $M_p$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Why do we use the above method to construct the quantum state $|\\vec{\\gamma},\\vec{\\beta}\\rangle$? QAOA tries to find an approximate optimal solution to an optimization problem. A similar algorithm is the quantum adiabatic algorithm [2] (QAA). The difference is that QAA is designed to find an optimal solution to the optimization problem rather than an approximate one. Similar to QAOA, QAA transforms an optimization problem into a problem of finding the ground state of a Hamiltonian, and uses the adiabatic theorem to solve it. Consider the Hamiltonian\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H(t) = (1-\\frac tT)H_B + \\frac tT H_C,\n",
    "\\tag{25}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "of a quantum system. At initial, time $t=0$, and the Hamiltonian of the system is $H(0) = H_B$. As time passes, the Hamiltonian of the system gradually changes from $H_B$ to $H_C$. When $t=T$, the Hamiltonian of the system becomes $H(T) = H_C$. The adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics tells us that if the system is in an eigenstate of $H_B$ at the beginning, then as long as the evolution time $T$ is long enough, the system will be in the eigenstate of the corresponding energy level of $H_C$ when the Hamiltonian of the system completely evolves to $H_C$. Therefore, if the system is initially in $|s\\rangle$, that is, the eigenstate with the largest eigenvalue of $H_B$, after a sufficiently long evolution time $T$, the quantum state of the system will become the eigenstate with the largest eigenvalue of $H_C$. [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to simulate the evolution of the Hamiltonian $H(t)$ over time $t$ is to alternately apply the unitary transformations $U_C(\\gamma)$ and $U_B(\\beta)$ on the quantum system, and the accuracy of simulation depends on the value of $\\gamma,\\beta$. In addition, in order for the evolution of the system to follow the adiabatic theorem, a sufficiently long evolution time is required, so the value of $p$ is required to be large enough. Therefore, combining equation (22) we can deduce the conclusion in equation (23)."
