    "Current finance problem can be mainly tackled by three areas of quantum algorithms: quantum simulation, quantum optimization, and quantum machine learning [1,2]. Many financial problems are essentially a combinatorial optimization problem, and corresponding algorithms usually have high time complexity and are difficult to implement. Due to the power of quantum computing, these complex problems are expected to be solved by quantum algorithms in the future.\n",

    "## Portfolio Diversification Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited by the lack of professional knowledge and market experience, the investor prefers a passive investment strategy in the actual investment. Index investing is a typical example of passive investing, e.g. an investor buys and holds the Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P 500) for a long period of time. As an investor, if you do not want to invest an existing index portfolio, you can also create your own specific index portfolio by picking representative stocks from the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important way to balance risk and return in an investment portfolio is to diversify your assets. A specific description of portfolio diversification is as follows: the number of investable stocks is $n$ and the number of stocks included in the portfolio is $K$. Based on some criteria, you need to divide all the stocks into $K$ categories and select the stock from each category that best represent that category. Adding representatives of each category to the index portfolio is better for investment management."

    "### Encoding Portfolio Diversification Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "To transform the portfolio diversification problem into a problem applicable for parameterized quantum circuits, we need to encode portfolio diversification problem into a Hamiltonian.\n",
    "\n",
    "To model the problem, two issues need to be clarified. The first one is how to classify different stocks, and the second one is what criteria are used to select representative stocks. To solve these two problems, firstly we define the similarity $\\rho_{ij}$ between stock $i$ and stock $j$:\n",
    "* $\\rho_{ii} = 1 \\quad $ The stock is similar to itself with a similarity of 1 \n",
    "* $\\rho_{ij} \\leq 1 \\quad$  The larger $\\rho_{ij}$ , the higher the similarity between stock $i$ and stock $j$\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the correlation of returns between stocks, we can further measure the similarity between the time series on the basis of the covariance matrix. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a common method to measure the similarity of two time series. In this paper, the DTW algorithm is used to calculate the similarity between two stocks. So based on the similarity between different stocks, we can classify the stocks and select representative stock in each category. We can define $n$ binary variables $x_{ij}$ and $1$ binary variables $y_j$ for each stock. Therefore, given $n$ stocks, there are $n^2 + n$ binary variables. For the variable $x_{ij}$, $i$ denotes the order of stock, and $j$ denotes the position among the $n$ binary variables corresponding to that stock. If two stock has same index of $j$, they are classified in the same category. Meanwhile, the stock of $i = j$ is the most representative one in that category selected to the index portfolio:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_{ij}=\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "1, & \\text{stock $j$ is in the portfolio and it has the highest similarity to stock $i$}\\\\\n",

    "0, & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The model can be written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{M}= \\max_{x_{ij}}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{j=1}^n \\rho_{ij}x_{ij}. \\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The model needs to satisfy the following constraints:\n",
    "* Clustering constraint: the index portfolio only include $K$ stocks\n",
    "    - $ \\sum_{j=1}^n y_j = K$\n",
    "* Integer constraint: a stock is either in the index portfolio or not\n",
    "     - $ x_{ij},y_j\\in{\\{0,1\\}}, \\forall i = 1, \\dots,n; j = 1, \\dots, n$\n",
    "* Consistency constraint: if a stock can represent another stock, it must be in the index portfolio\n",
    "    - $\\sum_{j=1}^n x_{ij} = 1, \\forall i = 1,\\dots,n$\n",
    "    - $x_{ij} \\leq y_j, \\forall i = 1,\\dots,n; j = 1,\\dots, n$\n",
    "    - $x_{jj} = y_j, \\forall j = 1,\\dots,n$\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the model is to maximize the similarity between the $n$ stocks and the selected index stock portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the loss function is to be optimized using the gradient descent method, some modifications are made in the loss function based on the the model equation and constrains:\n",
    "\n",

    "C_x &= -\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\rho_{ij}x_{ij} + A\\left(K- \\sum_{j=1}^n y_j \\right)^2 + \\sum_{i=1}^n A\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^n 1- x_{ij} \\right)^2 \\\\\n",
    "&\\quad + \\sum_{j=1}^n A\\left(x_{jj} - y_j\\right)^2 + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n A\\left(x_{ij}(1 - y_j)\\right).\\\\ \n",

    "\n",
    "The first term represents the similarity maximization, the next four terms are constraints. $A$ is the penalty parameter, which is usually set to a larger number so that the final binary string representing the index portfolio results satisfies the constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now need to transform the cost function $C_x$ into a Hamiltonian to realize the encoding of the portfolio diversification problem. Each variable $x_{ij}$ has two possible values, $0$ and $1$, corresponding to quantum states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$. Note that every variable corresponds to a qubit and so $n^2 + n$ qubits are needed for solving the portfolio diversification  problem. The Pauli $Z$ operator has two eigenstates which are the same as the states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ . Their corresponding eigenvalues are 1 and -1, respectively. So we consider encoding the cost function as a Hamiltonian using the pauli $Z$ matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we would like to consider the mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_{ij} \\mapsto \\frac{I-Z_{ij}}{2}, \\tag{3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Z_{ij} = I \\otimes I \\otimes \\ldots \\otimes Z \\otimes \\ldots \\otimes I$ with $Z$ operates on the qubit at position $ij$. Under this mapping, the value of $x_{ij}$ represent different meanings. If the qubit $ij$ is in state $|1\\rangle$, then $x_{ij} |1\\rangle = \\frac{I-Z_{ij}}{2} |1\\rangle = 1|1\\rangle $, which means stock $i$ is in index portfolio. Also, for the qubit $ij$ in state $|0\\rangle$, $x_{ij}|0\\rangle  = \\frac{I-Z_{ij}}{2} |0\\rangle = 0 |0\\rangle $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus using the above mapping, we can transform the cost function $C_x$ into a Hamiltonian $H_C$ for the system of $n^2+n$ qubits and realize the quantumization of the portfolio diversification problem. Then the ground state of $H_C$ is the optimal solution to the portfolio diversification problem. In the following section, we will show how to use a parametrized quantum circuit to find the ground state, i.e., the eigenvector with the smallest eigenvalue."

Also, the positions of $1$ in the first and third groups are satisfied with $i = j$, i.e., these two stocks are the most representative stock of their respective classes. It can be seen that $1$ appears at $j = 1$ and $j = 3$, i.e., two positions are possible for $1$, which corresponds to our presumption of having two stocks in the index portfolio. \n",
    "The last $3$ position is ``101``, which represents $y_j$, indicating that the first stock and the third stock are selected to the index portfolio. If the final result is not such a valid solution as described above, users can still get a better training result by adjusting the parameter values of the parameterized quantum circuit."

    "In this tutorial, we focus on how to classify investable stocks and how to select representative ones to our portfolio. In this problem, each investment item requires $n$ qubits to represent the classification and $1$ qubit to represent whether it is selected to portfolio or not. Due to the limitation of the number of qubits, the number of investment items that can be handled is still small."
