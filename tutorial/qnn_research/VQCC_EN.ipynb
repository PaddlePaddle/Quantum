    "Variational quantum circuit compilation is the process of simulating an unknown unitary operator by optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit. In this tutorial we will discuss two cases of unknown unitary operators. One is that the target $U$ is given as a matrix form, the other is that the $U$ is given as a black-box. We show how to obtain the loss function in both cases in Paddle Quantum. With auto-differentiation and optimizer provided with PaddlePaddle, we could easily approximate $U$ into a trainable sequence of quantum gates (here we use $V(\\vec{\\theta})$ to denote the unitary operator represented by the sequence of parameterized quantum gates, and for simplicity, we use $V$ below). Finally, we validate the optimized circuit by comparing the trace distance of various output density matrices transformed by the approximate circuit and the target $U$."

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier compilations of classical computers transformed binary numbers into electrical signals to drive the computer's electronic devices to perform operations, and then gradually developed into an assembly language for easy processing and writing. For quantum computers, similar to classical compilation, quantum compilation is a process of converting the unitary in a quantum algorithm into a series of the quantum gates to implement the algorithm. The current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices have limitations such as the number of qubits, circuit depth, etc., which pose a great challenge to quantum compilation algorithms. In [1], a quantum compilation algorithm, the Quantum-assisted Quantum Compiling (QAQC), has been proposed for efficient implementation on NISQ devices. The idea of QAQC is to compile the unknown target unitary operator $U$ into the unitary $V$, define the loss function using the gate fidelity, and continuously optimize a variational quantum circuit by minimizing the loss function. But how to measure the similarity of the two unitary operators? Here we consider the probability that the unitary evolution of the $V$ can simulate the $U$, i.e., the degree of overlap between $U|\\psi\\rangle$ and $V|\\psi\\rangle$ for the input state $|\\psi\\rangle$, which is the average of the fidelity on the Haar distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F(U,V)=\\int_{\\psi}|\\langle\\psi|V^{\\dagger}U|\\psi\\rangle|^2d\\psi,\n",
    "\\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When $F(U,V)=1$, there is a $\\phi$ such that $V=e^{i\\phi}U$, i.e., the two unitary operators differ by a global phase factor, at which point we call $V$ an exact compilation of $U$. When $F(U,V)\\geq 1-\\epsilon$, we call $V$ an approximate compilation of $U$, where $\\epsilon$ is an error and $\\epsilon\\in[0,1]$. Based on this, we can construct the following loss function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned} C(U,V)&=\\frac{d+1}{d}(1-F(U,V))\\\\\n",
    "&=1-\\frac{1}{d^2}|\\langle V,U\\rangle|^2\\\\\n",
    "&=1-\\frac{1}{d^2}|\\text{tr}(V^{\\dagger} U)|^2,\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "\\tag{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the number of qubits, $d=2^n$ and $\\frac{1}{d^2}|\\text{tr}(V^{\\dagger} U)|^2$ is the gate fidelity.\n",
    "\n",
    "From (2), we have that $C(V,U)=0$ if and only if $F(U,V)=1$, so we can obtain $V$ that approximates the target unitary operator $U$ by training a sequence of rotational gates with adjustable angles to minimize the loss function."

The results of the quantum compilation are demonstrated by two simple examples using Paddle Quantum. Then the approximate effect is checked by the trace distance of the quantum states after the evolution of the target unitary and the approximate unitary respectively. Finally the results in Paddle Quantum show that the quantum compilation is good."
