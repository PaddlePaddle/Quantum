    "In quantum mechanics, a system's energy is described with a Hamiltonian operator $H$. Solving all or partial properties of the Hamiltonian of a given system constitutes a central problem in many disciplines, including condensed matter physics, computational chemistry, high-energy physics, etc. However, the degrees of freedom of a quantum system grow exponentially with its system size, which leads to the inability to effectively simulate quantum systems using classical computers - the quantum state of several hundred qubits cannot be directly stored even with all the storage resources in the world. Unlike classical computers, quantum computers perform all operations directly on the exponentially large Hilbert space, thus having a natural advantage over classical computer when simulating a quantum system. Matter of fact, designing a controlled quantum system to efficiently simulate quantum systems in nature was Feynman's original idea when he first introduced the concept of quantum computing in the 1980s:\n",

    "### Verification of Suzuki-product formula-based time-evolving circuits using Paddle Quantum\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the upper bound on the error of the Suzuki-product formula has been continuously optimized, in practice, the real error is often different from the theoretical upper bound, i.e., the theoretical product formula error that we can calculate now is still only a very loose upper bound [3]. Therefore, for a real physical system, we often need to calculate the real error through numerical experiments to give an empirical bound on the error. Such numerical experiments are important as they could be used to determine the circuit depth needed to simulate a certain time evolution process at a certain accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `construct_trotter_circuit` function, It constructs by default a circuit based on the first order product formula. Users can create simulation circuits of higher order product formulas with more time blocks by manipulating the arguments `tau`, `steps`, `order`. As the last part of this tutorial, we will demonstrate how these options work in Paddle Quantum.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces how to construct a time-evolving circuit with Paddle Quantum and the theoretical basis behind it, i.e.the Suzuki product formula. Users can construct arbitrary order product formula circuits with custom Hamiltonian to simulate the time evolution of different physical systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum simulation is a vast subject and it covers a wide range of applications: the study of many-body localization, time crystals, high-temperature superconductivity, and topological order in condensed matter physics; molecular dynamics simulations and reaction simulations in quantum chemistry; field theory simulations in high-energy physics; even related applications in nuclear physics and cosmology. The Suzuki product formula and digital quantum simulations based on general-purpose quantum computers presented in this tutorial are only part of the quantum simulations. The quantum simulator not based on general-purpose quantum computers, such as analogue quantum simulations on cold atom, superconductor, ion trap and photon platforms also constitute very important topics. For readers who are interested on its applications and general background, we recommend this review [8]. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the subsequent tutorial [Simulating spin dynamics in one-dimensional Heisenberg chains](./SimulateHeisenberg_EN.ipynb), using the spin model in condensed matter physics as an example, we further show how to perform dynamics simulations of quantum many-body models. In the meantime, we also demonstrate how to design a customized time evolving circuit not based on the Suzuki decomposition.\n"
