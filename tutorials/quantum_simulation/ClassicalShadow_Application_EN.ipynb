    "In [The Classical Shadow of Unknown Quantum States](./ClassicalShadow_Intro_EN.ipynb), we introduced some theoretical knowledge of the classical shadow and showed how to construct the classical shadow of a quantum state $\\rho$. According to the theoretical derivation of the classical shadow, it is very suitable for estimating the linear properties of quantum states. At present, its basic applications are: quantum fidelity estimation, entanglement verification, the estimation of local observables' expectation values, and the estimation of global observables' expectation values [1]. Among them, the estimation of observables' expectation values widely appears in current quantum algorithms, such as [Variational Quantum Eigensolver](./VQE_EN.ipynb)  (VQE) for estimating the ground state energy of complex molecular Hamiltonian. Next, we will focus on the estimation of observables' expectation values algorithms based on the classical shadow and show how to use the shadow function in Paddle Quantum to do so."

    "In the field of quantum chemistry, one of the core tasks is to solve for ground state energy of the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ on a closed physical system on a quantum scale and its corresponding ground state. The main method is to prepare a parameterized trial wave function $|\\Psi(\\theta)\\rangle$. Then, the parameter $\\theta$ is being continuously adjusted and optimized to minimize the expected value $\\langle\\Psi(\\theta)|\\hat{H}| \\Psi(\\theta)\\rangle$ using classical optimization algorithms (such as gradient descent method). The principle of this scheme is based on Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle,\n",

Numerically, the problem can be understood as solving for the minimum eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\min }$ of a discretized Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ (Hermitian matrix) and its corresponding eigenvector $\\left|\\Psi_{0}\\right\\rangle$. Where the classical shadow comes into play is to calculate the $\\langle\\Psi(\\theta)|\\hat{H}| \\Psi(\\theta)\\rangle = \\operatorname{tr}(\\hat{H}\\rho )$ part in every optimization iteration where $ \\rho = | \\Psi(\\theta)\\rangle\\langle\\Psi(\\theta)|$.\n",

    "When constructing the classical shadow, a critical step is to uniformly and randomly sample the unitary transformation from the fixed set. In [The Classical Shadow of Unknown Quantum States](./ClassicalShadow_Intro_EN.ipynb), we showed the case when the selected set is the Clifford group. When the selected set is a Clifford group on single qubit, the process of sampling and measurement is equivalent to making Pauli measurements on the quantum states. The classical shadow algorithm using random Pauli measurements (CS) is provided in Paddle Quantum. Briefly, in the CS algorithm, we repeatedly choose a Pauli basis for each qubit uniformly at random to measure the quantum state $\\rho$ and estimate the observable's expectation value based on the measurement results, and the reader may refer to [1-2] to learn the details of the principle. Further, when the Pauli measurement base is no longer selected uniformly and randomly, improved algorithms are proposed [2-3]. Relevant algorithm functions are also provided in Paddle Quantum: Locally-biased classical shadows (LBCS) [2], Adaptive Pauli shadows (APS) [3]. Readers can refer to [1-3] to learn these algorithms in detail."

The item-by-item measurement method is to make 100 measurements for each item of the Hamiltonian, and there are 15 items of the Hamiltonian of H$_2$, which is equivalent to 1500 measurements in total. The difference between the obtained results and the energy of the estimated ground state by VQE is also tiny. In this small-scale situation, the classical-shadow-based algorithms do not show significant advantages over the item-by-item measurement method.

    "Then, we also use the VQE algorithm to obtain the ground state energy and the ground state of $LiH $ and then use the classical shadow algorithm to estimate the ground state energy. Due to the large size of the LiH molecular Hamiltonian, it will take a long time to train the VQE circuit. Hence we provide a set of pre-trained parameters, using which the users could test the classical-shadow-based algorithms on LiH Hamiltonian directly."

Then take the mean of these 20 samples of data as the estimation for each algorithm, and calculate the sample variance for a simple comparison of the algorithms.（It may take 20 minutes to run the following code blocks.）"

    "This tutorial discusses how to use the classical-shadow-based algorithms to estimate the observable's expectation value and shows how to use the `shadow` function in Paddle Quantum. It can be seen that the improved algorithm based on the classical shadow can get a good estimate of the observable's expectation value. Compared with the item-by-item measurement method, when the number of samples are the same, its estimated value is more accurate and the algorithm is more stable. In the large-scale qubit scenario, the number of samples required by the classical shadow method is only a constant increase in some tasks. So its role in the NISQ (noisy intermediate-scale quantum) era will continue to be explored."
