    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computation utilizes the peculiar laws in the quantum world and provides us with a novel and promising way of information processing. Nowadays, quantum computer is still in its early stage of development, with prohibitive manufacture, operating and maintenance costs. Fortunately, simulating quantum algorithms with classical computers is satisfactory to most scientific research and education. In 2012, John Preskill proposed the concept of \"quantum advantages\" (also known as \"quantum supremacy\"), starting a big competition between the performance of quantum and classical computers [1,2]. As different research teams announcing the achievements of quantum supremacy of their devices, there is also an increasing amount of people focusing on how to challenge the 'quantum supremacy' of those quantum computing devices, by designing efficient simulation algorithms in classical computers. How to improve the capability of simulating quantum algorithms classically is one of the most important topics in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "When simulating quantum algorithms on classical computers, we usually use column vectors to represent and store a quantum state. However, to store the information of a single qubit quantum state, we need a column vector of size $2 \\times 1$, while for an $n$-qubit quantum state, we need a column vector with the size as large as $2^{n} \\times 1$. Therefore, using column vectors to store a quantum state rapidly consumes memory and computational resources, as its size increases exponentially to the number of qubits. To break through this bottleneck, one approach is to replace the data structure of qubit's information storage. The commonly used data structures to replace column vectors include decision diagrams, tensor networks (including matrix product states), etc. Each data structure has its distinctive way of quantum circuit simulation. However, all these stay in the framework of **Quantum Circuit Model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another idea to solve the bottleneck of computation resources is to jump out of the framework of the quantum circuit model and simulate a circuit by its equivalents. **Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC)** [3-6] is another universal quantum computation model, that receives wide attention by its unique way of performing computation since its proposal. As is mentioned in [MBQC Quick Start Guide](MBQC_EN.ipynb), for non-adaptive measurements, not only can they be carried out simultaneously in physical implementation, but in classical simulation, they can also help to reduce the effective number of qubits in the computation, thus reducing the consumption of memory and computational resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will introduce a new scheme of quantum circuit simulation by firstly translating it into its MBQC equivalent and then optimizing the order of measurements to finally improve the simulation efficiency. In the meanwhile, we will also demonstrate applications of the ``circuit`` and ``mcalculus`` modules in our MBQC package by two concrete examples. "

    "We compare the running time between our simulation scheme and two other simulators (`statevector` and `matrix_product_state`) in Qiskit. We choose a shorter time from `statevector` and `matrix_product_state` as the running time of the Qiskit simulator. All the numerical experiments are conducted on a standard laptop with 16G RAM and Intel Core i7 10TH GEN CPU. The time comparison is shown in Figure 4. It is clear that our new simulation scheme provides a significant improvement over the Qiskit simulators for simulating shallow circuits.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "MBQC model provides a different technical route to realize universal quantum computation, in parallel with the quantum circuit model. By going from circuits to their MBQC equivalents, this tutorial provides a new scheme to speed up quantum circuit simulation. The improvement of our simulation scheme is evident for shallow circuits. We expect that this new idea will bring further advantages in applications of quantum machine learning and quantum neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we adopt the state vector for underlying simulation in the current MBQC package, the idea of quantum circuit simulation by MBQC is not limited to any data structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of quantum circuit simulation and MBQC based algorithms, there are still lots of unknowns to explore. Welcome to join us and discover the infinite possibilities of MBQC together!"
