    "Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a generative model, which is a breakthrough in deep learning in recent years [1]. It contains two parts: the generator $G$ and the discriminator $D$. The generator accepts a random noise signal and uses it as input to generate the data we expect. The discriminator evaluates the received data $x$ and outputs a probability $P(x)$ that the data $x$ is real."

    "\n",
    "Nash equilibrium refers to a non-cooperative game involving two or more participants, assuming that each participant knows other participants' equilibrium strategies. No participant can change one's strategy to benefit. In the game theory, if each participant chooses his strategy, and no player can benefit by changing the strategy while other participants remain the same, then the current set of strategy choices and their corresponding results constitute Nash Equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can regard the training process of GAN as a game process between generator and discriminator. No matter what the generator's strategy is, the best strategy of the discriminator is to try to distinguish the real data and the generated data. And regardless of the strategy of the discriminator, the best strategy for the generator is to make the discriminator unable to distinguish. This game is a zero-sum game, which is one of non-cooperative game. That is, one party gains while the other party must lose. Therefore, there exists the Nash equilibrium strategy in the game between the generator and the discriminator. When there are enough samples of real data and the learning ability of both parties is strong enough, a Nash equilibrium point will eventually be reached. **The generator has the ability to generate real data, and the discriminator can no longer distinguish between generated data and real data.** \n",
    "\n",
    "GAN adopts the idea of Nash equilibrium. In GAN, the generator and the discriminator are playing a non-cooperative game. No matter what strategies the generator adopts, the best strategy of the discriminator is to discriminate as much as possible; and no matter what strategies the discriminator adopts, the best strategy of the generator is to make the discriminator unable to discriminate as much as possible. Therefore, the two parties' strategic combination in the game and the corresponding results constitute the Nash equilibrium. **When the Nash equilibrium is reached, the generator can to generate real data, and the discriminator cannot distinguish between the generated data and the real data**."

    "The quantum generative adversarial network is similar to the classical one, except that it is no longer used to generate classical data but generate quantum states [2-3]. In practice, if we have a quantum state, it will collapse to a certain eigenstate after observation and cannot be restored to the previous quantum state. Therefore, if we have a method that generates many identical (or similar) quantum states based on the existing target quantum state, it will be very convenient for our experiments.\n",

Then we need to have a generator $G$ whose input is noise data, denoted by the ensemble $\\rho_{z}=\\sum_{i}p_{i}|z_{i}\\rangle\\langle z_ {i}|$. Therefore, we take out a random noise sample $|z_{i}\\rangle$ every time and get the generated quantum state $|x\\rangle=G|z_{i}\\rangle$ after passing through the generator. We expect the generated $| x\\rangle$ that is close to the target quantum state $\\rho$.\n",

    "In this dynamic picture, each frame represents an iterative process. In an iteration, the red line on the left represents the loss curve of the discriminator, and the blue line on the right represents the loss curve of the generator. It can be seen that at the initial stage, the discriminator and generator can gradually learn from a poor discriminant ability and generation ability to a better discrimination ability and generation ability in the current situation. As the learning progresses, the generator’s generation ability is getting stronger and stronger, and the discriminator’s ability is getting stronger and stronger. However, the discriminator can not distinguish the real data and the generated data because the generator has generated data close to real data. At this time, the model has converged."
